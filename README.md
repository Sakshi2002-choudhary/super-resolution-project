# Super-Resolution using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the use of deep learning models such as U-Net, SRGAN, and ESRGAN for enhancing low-resolution images using the DIV2K dataset.

## 📂 Dataset
Kaggle: [Image Super Resolution Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityachandrasekhar/image-super-resolution/data)

## 🚀 Models Used
- U-Net
- VGG16 + U-Net
- ResNet + U-Net
- SRGAN
- ESRGAN

## 📦 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook:  
   Open `super-resolution (2).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

## 📊 Evaluation
- Metrics: PSNR, SSIM
